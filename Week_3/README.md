# Week 3

<p>Week 3 had lectures reviewing functions and decomposition, and then the last set
of lectures was regarding image manipulation.  Code in Place used the SimpleImage module
which was developed at Stanford and is based on the Pillow library.

[More information about simpleimage](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106ap/cs106ap.1198/handouts/h10_Image_Reference_Guide.pdf)

The simpleimage library needs the simpleimage.py file (found in the main directory) to work.

Simpleimage uses pixel manipulation to change images.  Each pixel has its own RGB values, which
can be mutated.  The assignments from this week apply a filter to a picture, create a 
forest fire map, and create a reflected image.
